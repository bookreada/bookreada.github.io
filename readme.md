# Welcome to DUBS

You're just a few steps away from having your own self editing web page!

- Create a GitHub (or GitLab or ...) account.
- Get a token.
- Fork this repo to <yourusername>.github.io.
- Change everything.

Done :-)

### So what is this anyway?
Let's say it's a template driven mini-CMS that lives on a web page: You can change the web page from itself (and a web browser, of course) because it can update the git repository that contains its contents.  
You can create your own social networks just by forking repos. Don't like someone's contents? Fork someone else or just stop pulling.. These networks include some interesting properties, e.g. you can always have a complete copy just by cloning to a local machine, moving the network to another host just means pushing the repo somewhere else, while at the same time you don't need any infrastructure. Information goes downstream by pulling, upstream by pull requests.

### So how does this work?
The page itself is hosted as a special git repository that also happens to be available as a web page. The web page simply contains a git client that changes the repository.

### ... and why?
Because that's what DUB means to me (-:
