# Welcome to DUBS

You're just a few steps away from having your own self editing web page!

- Create a GitHub (or GitLab or ...) account.
- Get a token.
- Fork this repo to <yourusername>.github.io.
- Change everything.

Done :-)

### So what is this anyway?
Let's say it's a template driven mini-CMS that lives on a web page: You can change the web page from itself (and a web browser, of course) because it can update the git repository that contains its contents.

### So how does this work?
The page itself is hosted as a special git repository that also happens to be available as a web page. The web page simply contains a git client that changes the repository.

### ... and why?
Because that's what DUB means to me (-:
